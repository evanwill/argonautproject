# The Argonaut digital newspaper collection

## background

The Argonaut is a student news paper http://www.uiargonaut.com/
The Argonaut was digitized from a mircofilm collection by outside contractors and delivered as OCRed PDFs.
Each PDF filename is the issue date, providing the most basic metadata. 
Additional metadata about each issue was provided by an exisiting [index](http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/find/argonaut.html) created for access to the physical collection.
However, this index is not complete and does not cover all items in the digital collection. 

The [digital collection](http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/search/collection/argonaut) is hosted on a CONTENTdm server.
It was uploaded to the server with the metadata. 
CDM automatically extracts OCR text from the PDFs during upload and adds a "full text" field.
However, the "full text" field is limited to 128,000 characters.
