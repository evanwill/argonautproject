# The Argonaut digital newspaper collection

## background

University of Idaho's student newspaper, [The Argonaut](http://www.uiargonaut.com/), has been in print since 1889. 
Approximately 6,000 issues of The Argonaut were digitized from a mircofilm collection by outside contractors and delivered as OCRed PDFs.
The [digital collection](http://digital.lib.uidaho.edu/cdm/search/collection/argonaut) is hosted on a CONTENTdm server.
Unfortunately the reality of providing access to this fascinating resource is more difficult that it seems. 

Issues arose due to the poor quality of the materials digitized, variable quality of OCR in derivative files, and limitations of our content management system. An [index](http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/find/argonaut.html) used to access print copies in special collections provided simple metadata for approximately half the issues, but the remaining issues had only a date and the full text field extracted from OCR. Anyone who has seen OCR on low quality materials knows how ugly it can be...

A large portion of the OCR transcript is gibberish, full of white space and odd punctuation. CDM limits the size of full text fields, so this low value metadata doesn't even fit. How can I increase the usefulness of this information to enable access to the materials?
